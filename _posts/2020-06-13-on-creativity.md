title: "On Creativity 关于创作"

我突然意识到了“灵感来的时候挡也挡不住”究竟是源自何处。<br/>
音乐创作于我而言，是一个接收与再创造的过程。<br/>
我接收到的信息汇总之后会形成歌词、旋律，这也许是因为我天生就善于用音乐、声音表达，也或许是我从小弹钢琴、唱歌，所以这种表达方式变成了习惯。<br/>
而我做作品的时候，其实就是把当时的所听所感、所见所闻进行还原，力求原封不同地呈现出来。<br/>
所以我总是知道作品做到啥样子才算完整，又知道缺东西的时候缺的是什么感觉。<br/>
<br/>
我的原创性，根源是我的感官、身体、心神与世界的交流。<br/>
我的创造力，来自于我自我沉淀和自我抽身的能力。<br/>
自我沉淀时“我”会坠落下去，因此世界就浮现上来。自我抽身时，“我”脱离了肉体所在的系统，以一个旁边者的角度去看眼前的一切。<br/>
自我沉淀时，我可以控制自己把意识分到耳朵、眼睛、鼻子、心脏、手指、等等身体的部位。这个时候没有“我”。<br/>
自我抽身时，我会完全忘记我身体的存在，所有的意识都在“大脑”的位置，都在“我”。而这个”我“在审慎、冰冷地去看世界。<br/>
我的作品确实是代号为刘乐童的可行走个体/包裹的东西，因为在那个天时地利人和的时间点或片段，这个身体与大脑加在一起的个体与世界交流的内容，是不可复制的。<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All of a sudden, I realized where the notion, or rather, the feeling of "I can't resist inspirations rushing towards me like the rolling tide" comes from. <br/>
The creation of music, for me, is a reciprocal process of receiving and recreating. <br/> 
The information comes together after floating into me, and forms into lyrics and/or melodies. Maybe I am naturally good at expressing myself through music and voice, or maybe I grew up playing the piano and singing all the time, so this way of expression has turned into a habit. <br/>
When I produce my creations, it is in essense presenting what I heard, what I felt, what I saw, and what I smelled at the very moment in its original form and context. <br/>
Hence, I always know what completeness of a piece means, and what it lacks when there are pieces meaning. <br/>
<br/>
My originality, takes roots in the conversations that my senses, my body, my heart and my spirits had with the world around me as an individual system. <br/>
My creativity, comes from self-precipitation and self-extraction. <br/>
Self-precipitation means "I" will fall, so then the world can and will emerge. Self-extraction means "I" am detached from the physical body, so that I can see everything within sight as an outsider. <br/>
In the former state, I can control myself to distribute consciousness to my ears, eyes, nose, heart, fingers and other parts of the body. "I" am not present in this scenario. <br/>
In the latter state, I completely forget the existence of the body, and all of the consciousness is congregated at where the brain, or "I", sit(s). And this "I", is prudently, ice-coldly viewing the world. <br/>
My creations are indeed creations of this movable unit/packaged labelled Gab Liu. This is simply due to the irreproducibility of the content of that conversation, which was generated at the very point of time or small fragment of time, at that very geographic spot, and with the very group of lives.
