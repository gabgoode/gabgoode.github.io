			Hi! I'm Gab, and thank you for walking into my life :)<br/>
			I am a creator at heart, and I love to live in an active, organic, experiential, and experimental way. <br/>
			<br/>
			I spent the first 18 years in Beijing, and loved my life there deeply. It is my first home, where I got to endlessly absorb everything (mostly love, kindness, and happiness) around me as a new soul.<br/>
			<br/>
			I moved to the States for college when I was 18 years old. I spent the first two years in Oberlin College outside Cleveland Ohio, and thought I could start a career as a composer. However, I accidentally fall in love with Pure Mathematics thanks to my advisor <a href= "https://www2.oberlin.edu/faculty/kwoods/">Kevin Woods</a>. I also realized that I am a city girl, so I transferred to Wellesley College after my sophomore year. <br/>
			During my time at Wellesley, I continuted to grow my interestes in Mathematics, and thought I wanted to be a Mathematician for the rest of my life, until I had a transformational near-death experience in Cape Town, South Africa when I was 21 years old. <br/>
			I came back, finished my degree and graduated top of the class. However, I am most proud of myself for creating <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gab-liu/up-in-the-air">Up in the Air</a> with <a href="http://www.jennyoliviajohnson.com/">Jenny Olivia Johnson</a>, who so kindly shared her knowledge with me, and pushed me to step out of the box. <br/>
			Now, after a year working as a software engineer in the Greater Boston Area, I am ready to say farewell to the second era of my life, a period of time where I explored inwards as much as possible. I am a very greedy person, as I also explored and experienced the US as much as I could for the past 5 years. <br/>
			<br/>
			Starting from September 2020, I will give myself a year-long break that I've long desired to have and finally reached a point where I could financially sustain myself to do so. I have no plans, but a lot of wishes :) I hope that after this break, I can feel physically, mentally, and emotioanly ready to welcome the third stage of my life! <br/>
		<br/>
			Okay, now some random things that I am devoting time and energy to at the moment... <br/>
			I am working on 3 new compositions, titled "Rhapsody in Wind", "Galaxy", and "A Midsummer Night's Dream" respectively. Feel free to reach out if you are curious about my demos, and I would love feedback!<br/>
			I am reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24113.G_del_Escher_Bach">GEB</a> at the moment, and it is THE absolute favourite of mine. <br/>
		<br/>
			In general... <br/>
			I try not to have too many attachments, but I do love my little obsessions. <br/>
			I think I only need to do two things in life: the most difficult thing that I could possibly do and the simplest thing that I could possibly do. <br/>
			I want to spend a lifetime experiencing the world as much as possible, while attempting to understand myself, and what it means to be me. <br/>
			I am living each day to the simplest yet fullest, listening to my heart, my mind, and the world around me. I also keep a journal to record my daily thoughts and sensual pleasures. <br/>

			Hi! 我是Gab，欢迎走进我的生活 :)<br/>
			我的本质是一个创造者。我热爱有活力、自然、体验式、实验性的生活。<br/>
			<br/>
			我最近在创作两个新的音乐作品, 分别名为 “银河”和“仲夏夜之梦”。如果你很好奇，欢迎email我来试听小样。<br/>
			我正在读 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24113.G_del_Escher_Bach">GEB</a>。超爱这本书且强烈推荐！ <br/>
			我目前工作和生活在马塞诸塞州的剑桥。我不知道下一站会去哪里，但是我太爱满世界跑了！来收听我的播客和我一起踏上发现之旅吧 :P<br/>
		<br/>
			我试图不让自己有太多牵挂，但是我很爱那些令我迷恋的点滴。<br/>
			我觉得生活中只需做两件事：最难的事和最简单的事。 <br/>
			我要用一生来尽可能多去体验世界，在这个过程中尝试去了解自己，以及作为“我”又为何意。<br/>
			我每天在做很简单的事，倾听我的内心、我的大脑、和我周围的世界。我也有记日记的习惯，每天写下当天的想法和令我开心享受的事情。<br/>
