<i>"Listen. Can you hear? The music. I can hear it everywhere. In the wind, in the air, in the light. It's all around us." <br/>
"All you have to do, is open yourself up. All you have to do, is listen." --- August Rush <i> <br/>
<br/>
I know exactly how that feel. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I am an air bender. Maybe I am an orchestrator. Maybe both. <br/>
<br/>
Everything around me was singing, everything around me was grooving, everything around me came together, at this very moment. <br/>
<br/>
And I was with everything around me. And I felt the sweet, lovely, simple joy. And I was in this world, but the pedestrians passing by were not. <br/>
<br/>
Now you may ask how I knew this. I just knew it. <br/>
<br/>
Their bodies were too uptight. Their eyes were gazing too straight ahead. <br/>
<br/>
They were too exhausted, too busy, and too flat that they could not possibly be there.
