"Listen. Can you hear? The music. I can hear it everywhere. In the wind, in the air, in the light. It's all around us." <br/>
"All you have to do, is open yourself up. All you have to do, is listen." <br/>
--- August Rush <br/>
<br/>
I know exactly how that feel. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I am an air bender. Maybe I am an orchestrator. Maybe both. <br/>
<br/>
Everything around me was singing, everything around me was grooving, everything around me came together, at this very moment. <br/>
<br/>
And I was with everything around me. And I felt the sweet, lovely, simple joy. And I was in this world, but the pedestrians passing by were not. <br/>
<br/>
Now you may ask how I knew this. I just knew it. <br/>
<br/>
Their bodies were too uptight. Their eyes were gazing too straight ahead. <br/>
<br/>
They were too exhausted, too busy, and too flat that they could not possibly be there. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“ 听。你能听见吗？音乐。它无处不在。在风、空气、光中，萦绕在我们身边。”<br/>
“ 你只需敞开自己。你只需倾听。”<br/>

<br/>
我有100%的亲身体验。 <br/>
<br/>
也许我可以支配气，也许我可以编排声部，也许两者都可以。<br/>
<br/>
我周围的万物在歌唱、舞动。他们凝聚在一起，此时此刻。 <br/>
<br/>
我和他们融为一体，享受着甜美的、可爱的、孩童般的欢娱。我在这个世界里，而经过我的路人们并不在。<br/>
<br/>
你可能会问，我如何知道？我就是知道。<br/>
<br/>
他们的身体太僵硬了。他们的眼神发直无神。<br/>
<br/>
他们太累了，太忙了，太平了，以至于他们不可能在这个世界中。
<br/>
