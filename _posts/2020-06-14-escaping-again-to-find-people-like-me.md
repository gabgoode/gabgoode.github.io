Although I am a city girl, at times I just need to escape from the city. More, lately. <br/>
<br/>
Thursday, I walked for three hours in the rain. I was soaked, but it didn't bother me. The wind, the rain, energized me. I riased my chin, lifted my arms, and closed my eyes, to open myself up, to embrace and to relish in. <br/>
I had an entire Hawaiian pizza. The last time I had pizza was probably two years ago. It tastes very good, that interwoven sense of flavors. I felt very happy :) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Friday, I took another long walk along the Charles River at dusk. It made me smile to see people peacefully sitting on the grass, enjoying the sky as much as I do. <br/>
But somehow, I felt sentimental, about leaving Cambridge. I knew, it was time to say farewell, to this city that I've once loved deeply, this city that I see as my second home. <br/>
Jenny Xie's words came back to me, "Funny, the way we come to understand a place by wanting to escape it. " <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Saturday morning, I went for a bike ride along the minuteman bike path. Being too familiar with the path, I didn't enjoy the active times of solitude as much. There were also too many people. Even at 7am! <br/>
My space was intruded by my roommate's boyfriend. He kept breaking into my world because he didn't know where to put himself. I tried to stay away, but at one point I'm just so fed up with him. "Please, just leave me alone." <br/>
I went out for a walk again, but Cambridge is too loud.
