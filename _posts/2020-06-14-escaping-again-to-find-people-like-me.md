Although I am a city girl, at times I just need to escape from the city. More, lately. <br/>
<br/>
Thursday, I walked for three hours in the rain. I was soaked, but it didn't bother me. The wind, the rain, energized me. I riased my chin, lifted my arms, and closed my eyes, to open myself up, to embrace and to relish in. <br/>
I had an entire Hawaiian pizza. The last time I had pizza was probably two years ago. It tastes very good, that interwoven sense of flavors. I felt very happy :) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Friday, I took another long walk along the Charles River at dusk. It made me smile to see people peacefully sitting on the grass, enjoying the sky as much as I do. <br/>
But somehow, I felt sentimental, about leaving Cambridge. I knew, it was time to say farewell, to this city that I've once loved deeply, this city that I see as my second home. <br/>
Jenny Xie's words came back to me, "Funny, the way we come to understand a place by wanting to escape it. " <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Saturday morning, I went for a bike ride along the minuteman bike path. Being too familiar with the path, I didn't enjoy the active times of solitude as much. There were also too many people. Even at 7am! <br/>
My space was intruded by my roommate's boyfriend. He kept breaking into my world because he didn't know where to put himself. I tried to stay away, but at one point I'm just so fed up with him. "Please, just leave me alone." <br/>
I went out for a walk again, but Cambridge is too loud. My energy blocks were almost used up, and I can't find a sustainble source that allows me to reproduce these energy blocks. So I felt drained, and stuck, and I cried like a kid. I can't wait any longer. I need to leave as soon as possible. I need to save myself. <br/>
I called Priscilla before bedtime. I explained to her my pain, and she felt my pain, and she shed tears with me. We talked about "people like us", and how we both love the book GEB so much. That love comes from a sense of comfort, as she described, and a sense of validation, as I described. It feels good to know that, though people like us are rare, they exist. <br/>
She never defined what "people like us" meant. But I completely understand what she meant. That's how we became friends, in fact. I strongly sensed that she is my kind, so I approached her with determination of wanting to be friends with her. She said she could access in an unfamilar situation, who she could vibe with. I could too. <br/>
We agreed that another characteristic of people like us is that we are super observant. We both would always point out the most random things on walks, and feel so fascinated, captivated by their intricacies. <br/>
Priscilla told me that I have more bravery. I think so too. I am more proactive, more willing to take risks in having these types of conversations. <br/>
I feel a sense of urgency, because I don't have enough time, so I need to try harder to find people like me. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sunday morning, right now, I biked to Seaport and I'm sitting on the stairs, facing water. On my way here, I had this thought that maybe Alan Turing, John Nash, and John Horton Conway were "people like us". That's why I had so much affinity for and appreciation of them, despite the fact that I know little about them. <br/>
I texted Kevin this morning, said some gibberish that I was a bit unconfident to share. He texted back with firm. "That's a really good list of attrivutes of intelligence...A developmental psychology professor once told me that things like this list (dealing with ambiguity in particular) are things 18-year-olds are really bad at, and there is still physical brain development happening 18-21 that enables them to get better at it." <br/>
That last sentence helped me make more sense as to why I've always felt so fortunate to have studied pure Mathematics in college.<br/>
You know what, I'm quite lucky. There probably aren't that many people like me in terms of ratio, but I've found my way to connect with a few in real life. <br/>
I sahll keep searching, and keep being brave. <br/>
