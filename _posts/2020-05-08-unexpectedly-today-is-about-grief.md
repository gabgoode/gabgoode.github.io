Unexpectedly, today is about, grief, <br/> 
just like unexpectedly, trauma drills you down. <br/>
出乎意料，今天关于, 悲痛， <br/>
就像出乎意料，创伤把你钻透。 <br/>
Unexpectedly, I listened to the episode titled <em>One Last Thing Before I Go</em> of <em>This American Life</em>, <br/>
and unexpectedly but understandably, I felt the heartbroken pain through the voices recorded in <em>"kaze no denwa"</em>. <br/>
没有想到，我刚好听到 <em>This American Life</em> 里标题为 <em>One Last Thing Before I Go</em> 的这一集，<br/>
更没有想到却合乎情理，我感受到了“风的电话”亭中记录下来的那些声音中的碎心痛苦。<br/>
I have always been an empathetic person, but I don't know whether it's a blessing or a curse. <br/>
我一直是个很能共情的人，但我不知道这是好事还是坏事。<br/>
I couldnt' help but crying harder and harder. <br/>
我忍不住哭的越来越厉害。<br/>
I called my dad. <br/>
我给爸爸打了个电话。<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I told him: "I just realized that I haven't let go of my past traumas." <br/>
我告诉他，我突然意识到我对过去的创伤还没释怀。<br/>
We talked a lot. Just like many times before. <br/>
我们聊了很多。就像之前的许多次一样。<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lei asked me an unprepared question the other day, <br/>
which is, "How do you reconcile with your past self?" <br/>
蕾那天问了我一个她没有提前准备的问题，<br/>
“你如何和过去的自己和解？” <br/>
I did not answer very well on the spot, so it has been on my mind for the past few days. <br/>
我当时没有回答的很好，所以这几天我一直在想着这个问题。<br/>
I asked my dad as well. <br/>
我也问了爸爸这个问题。<br/>
We agreed that I am adventurous by nature, so I should keep being adventurous. Going to places, trying and learning new things, and do whatever I want. <br/>
我们都同意我天性爱冒险，所以我应该继续去探索世界。去新的国家，去尝试和学习，去做自己想做的事情。<br/>
Dad restated that he only demands two things: safety and health. <br/>
爸爸说他只有两个要求：安全和健康。<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We talked for a bit more than an hour. <br/>
我们聊了一个小时多一点。<br/>
I only appreciated him until recently. TRULY APPRECIATE.<br/>
我直到最近才意识到他的好。真正意识到。<br/>
He never compared me with others. "You are you", he said. <br/>
他从来没有拿我和别人比。“你就是你“，爸爸说。<br/>
He laid a strong foundation so that I could grow freely, at my own will, <br/>
and moreover, he never asked anything from me. <br/>
他给我铺实了安全的土壤，允许我自由地生长，按照我的意愿，<br/>
更重要的，他从来没有向我所要。<br/>
I'm going to be 23 in 4 days. How come I just realized that I already have the best gift a daughter could ever asked her from her father. <br/>
我还有4天就到23岁了。我竟然才惊醒，我已经得到了一个父亲可以给予女儿最好的礼物。<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Before we hang up, he told me : "Even though you are not completely relieved, I can see you getting there." <br/>
我们挂断电话之前，他跟我讲：“虽然你还没有完全释怀，但我觉得你在慢慢转变了。” <br/>
He sounds gratified. I thought there was a catch in his voice. <br/>
他听上去很欣慰。我觉得他讲话时有些哽咽。<br/>
I called him after my friends did not pick up, but I'm gald IT WAS HIM that I talked to this morning.<br/>
发现朋友们都在忙以后我才给他打的电话，但我很开心早上跟我长谈的是他。<br/>
After all, he was the only one who was always there. <br/>
毕竟，一直站在我身后的，是爸爸。<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also texted Matt the same question. <br/>
我也问了Matt同样的问题。<br/>
"It's true - we need to forgive ourselves." He replied after I followed up to his initial response. <br/>
“没错，我们需要原谅自己。“ 我在他第一条回复后又追问道，他这样回复。<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I texted Lei. <br/>
我给Lei发了短信。<br/>
"...I realized the biggest problem for the past two years for me has been that I could not forgive my past self. And becuase of that, I started to question my nature as an adventurer, and that caused a lot of pain and conflicts for me. Thanks for a great question that helped me figure it out! " <br/>
“...我意识到过去的两年间我最大的问题在于我无法原谅我自己。因为这样，我开始怀疑自己爱冒险的天性，这给我带来了许多痛苦与矛盾。谢谢你的好问题帮我意识到了这一点！“ <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I feel calm. <br/>
I had closure. At least a small circle. <br/>
Unexpectedly. <br/>
我感到平静 <br/>
我得到了闭环。至少是一个小句号。<br/>
出乎意料。<br/>
