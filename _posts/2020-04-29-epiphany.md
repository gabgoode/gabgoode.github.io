Epiphany! What a precious feeling that almost always hits you unexpectedly.<br/> 
顿悟，一种太珍贵却又可遇不可求的感受。<br/>
<br/>
I've been going through a wave of Eureka moments recently thanks to rare, long hours in solitude. <br/> 
最近难得的独处时间让我有幸多次接受顿悟瞬间的洗礼。<br/>
<br/>
I realized why I had to major in Mathematics. Who else other than Mathematicians would understand how incredible the world inside your mind is when you close your eyes. That's when we actually SEE and FEEL things. <br/>
我意识到为什么我注定要学数学。没有谁能像数学家们一样可以理解闭上双眼后，那个出现在你眼前的世界是多么神奇美妙。那时我们才真正开始看见并感受到事物。<br/>
<br/>
I realized why I can let go of my eyes, but never my hands. What else other than my tools to create define me as a human. That's what we are here for, TO CREATE what not yet exists.<br/>
我意识到为什么我可以接受失去双眼。但无法承受失去双手。没有什么能替代我用来创造的工具来证明我是人类。那是我们来到这里的目的，去创造那些不存在的东西。<br/>
<br/>
I realized why I went to South Africa and nearly died there. When else am I going to understand that life is short and there's always more out there. That's WHO I AM as someone who restlessly craves for novel experiences.<br/>
我意识到为什么我会去南非又差点死在那里。没有一个更好的时机让我懂得生命很短而又有那么多要看可看的东西。那就是我，一个马不停蹄去寻找新奇体验的人。<br/>
<br/>
Epiphany! When things suddenly make sense and pieces finally come together. <br/>
顿悟，当你终于可以解释之前讲不通的问题，当散点终于连成一条线。<br/>
<br/>
That clarity. It's like when a beam of morning sunlight wakes up the forest. That thoroughness. It's like when you are sweating bullets after the longest possible run.<br/>
那种明朗, 就好像一束晨光唤醒森林。那种通彻, 就好像跑到不剩一丝力气之后的大汗淋漓。
