			Hi! I'm Gab, and thank you for walking into my life :)<br/>
			I am a creator at heart, and I love to live in an active, organic, experiential, and experimental way. <br/>
			<br/>
			I spent the first 18 years in Beijing, and loved my life there deeply. It is my first home, where I got to endlessly absorb everything (mostly love, kindness, and happiness) around me as a new soul.<br/>
			<br/>
			I moved to the States for college when I was 18 years old. I spent the first two years in Oberlin College outside Cleveland Ohio, and thought I could start a career as a composer. However, I accidentally fall in love with Pure Mathematics thanks to my advisor <a href= "https://www2.oberlin.edu/faculty/kwoods/">Kevin Woods</a>. I also realized that I am a city girl, so I transferred to Wellesley College after my sophomore year. <br/>
			During my time at Wellesley, I continuted to grow my interestes in Mathematics, and thought I wanted to be a Mathematician for the rest of my life, until I had a transformational near-death experience in Cape Town, South Africa when I was 21 years old. <br/>
			I came back, finished my degree and graduated top of the class. However, I am most proud of myself for creating <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gab-liu/up-in-the-air">Up in the Air</a> with <a href="http://www.jennyoliviajohnson.com/">Jenny Olivia Johnson</a>, who so kindly shared her knowledge with me, and pushed me to step out of the box. <br/>
			Now, after a year working as a software engineer in the Greater Boston Area, I am ready to say farewell to the second era of my life, a period of time where I explored inwards as much as possible. I am a very greedy person, as I also explored and experienced the US as much as I could for the past 5 years. <br/>
			<br/>
			Starting from September 2020, I will give myself a year-long break that I've long desired to have and finally reached a point where I could financially sustain myself to do so. I have no plans, but a lot of wishes :) I hope that after this break, I can feel physically, mentally, and emotioanly ready to welcome the third stage of my life! <br/>
		<br/>
			Okay, now some random things that I am devoting time and energy to at the moment... <br/>
			I am working on 3 new compositions, titled "Rhapsody in Wind", "Galaxy", and "A Midsummer Night's Dream" respectively. Feel free to reach out if you are curious about my demos, and I would love feedback!<br/>
			I am reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24113.G_del_Escher_Bach">GEB</a> at the moment, and it is THE absolute favourite of mine. <br/>
		<br/>
			In general... <br/>
			I try not to have too many attachments, but I do love my little obsessions. <br/>
			I think I only need to do two things in life: the most difficult thing that I could possibly do and the simplest thing that I could possibly do. <br/>
			I want to spend a lifetime experiencing and learning about the world as much as possible, while attempting to constantly open up, unlock, and understand myself. <br/>
			I am living each day to the simplest yet fullest, listening to my heart, my mind, and the world around me. I also keep a journal to record my daily thoughts and sensual pleasures. <br/>

			Hi! 我是Gab，欢迎走进我的生活 :)<br/>
			我的本质是一个创造者。我热爱有活力、自然、体验式、实验性的生活。<br/>
			<br/>
			我出生在一个很有爱的老北京家庭，人生最初的18年是在北京度过的，我很爱自己在那里的生活。这是我第一个家，在这里我作为一个初来这个世界的灵魂尽情地瞬息着周围的一切（大多是爱、善良、幸福）。<br/>
			<br/>
			18岁的时候一个人搬来美国上大学。头两年在克利夫兰外的Oberlin College度过，选择来这里是因为当初想当一个作曲家，也想体验一下小镇的生活。结果，在我的数学导师<a href= "https://www2.oberlin.edu/faculty/kwoods/">Kevin Woods</a>的影响下，我爱上了纯数（理论数学）。我也意识到自己还是喜欢大城市，所以大二毕业以后转去了Wellesley College。
			在Wellesley的时候对于数学的热爱继续生根发芽，很认真地想这辈子就当一个数学家了，直到21岁的夏天一个人跑去南非的时候经历了一个改变我人生的临死体验。（其实是第二次临死体验）<br/>
			好在我后来回到了平常的生活，完成了学业并以自己还挺满意的水准毕业。不过，令我最骄傲的是最后一个学期在<a href="http://www.jennyoliviajohnson.com/">Jenny Olivia Johnson</a>的指导下我做了一个很自我突破的作品<a href="https://soundcloud.com/gab-liu/up-in-the-air">《在云端》</a>。<br/>
			现在，在波士顿当了一年程序员以后，我觉得是时候跟人生的第二个阶段，即向内探索的阶段，告别了。我还是个很贪心的人，因为过去的5年里不仅充分地作为一个独立个体进行自我探索，同时也深入了解了美国这个新大陆。<br/>
			<br/>
			从2020年9月起，我要给自己放个很久以来很期盼的一年的假期，也很庆幸自己能够在资金上支持自己去做这件事。这一年不会有计划，但会去实现大大小小的心愿。我希望这一年结束的时候自己可以在身心和情感上都觉得准备好迎接人生的第三个阶段！<br/>
			<br/>
			好啦！现在来谈谈眼前正在做的事...<br/>
			我正在构思3首新的音乐作品，目前分别起名“风中狂想曲”，“银河”，和“仲夏夜之梦”。很期待和各种音乐人合作！<br/>
			我正在读 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24113.G_del_Escher_Bach">GEB</a>，这本书可能现在是心头之爱！ <br/>
		<br/>
			大体上来说...<br/>
			我试图不让自己有太多牵挂，但是我很爱那些令我迷恋的点滴。<br/>
			我觉得生活中只需做两件事：最难的事和最简单的事。 <br/>
			我要用一生来尽可能多去体验、了解世界，在这个过程中不断打开、解锁和认识自己。<br/>
			我每天在做很简单的事，倾听我的内心、我的大脑、和我周围的世界。我也有记日记的习惯，每天写下当天的想法和令我开心享受的事情。<br/>
