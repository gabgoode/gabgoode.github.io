Wisteria floating, like a ballerina glissading,<br/>
紫藤萝花的藤蔓飘荡，像芭蕾舞者滑步，<br/>
Weeping beech waving, like an urban dancer freestlying, <br/>
垂枝山毛榉的枝叶摆动，像一个编舞者随风而跳，<br/>
Airy? Morbidezza? Euphonic? <br/>
灵动？柔美？悦耳？<br/>
there's a sensual harmony, brought by wind, brought by force, <br/>
有一种身心聚拢，自下而上的和谐，来自风，来自力，<br/>
that I can only feel, that I will wholeheartedly feel... <br/>
我只能体会，我尽情体会...<br/>
<br/>
I can see the underlying structures vividly, they are always tree-like, <br/>
but where do the seeds come from, and who planted them...<br/>
我可以看到清晰的底层脉络，它们总是树一样的结构，<br/>
但是种子从哪里来，又是谁在种下？<br/>
I can see the paths of connections animated, they are almost ubiquitous, <br/>
but what is the ultimate shape, a line or a circle...<br/>
我可以看到运动的连接路径，它们无处不在，<br/>
但是哪个才是最终的形状，一条线还是一个圆...<br/>
<br/>
I am hesitant to make absolute statements, but I believe there is some truth to hetu-phala, <br/>
我犹豫下定论，但我认为因果论有些道理，<br/>
I do not have enough evidence, but I believe things are interconnected, <br/>
我没有足够证据，但我相信事物交错相搭，<br/>
I cannot figure out my brain, but I believe it's a black box, <br/>
我无法明白我的大脑，但我知道他是个黑匣子，<br/>
<br/>
I might think in images, although right now it's only a theory, <br/>
我可能用图像思考，不过现在还停留在理论，<br/>
I can instantly transform sound that I hear into images that I see in my mind, <br/>
我有把听到的声音迅速转成波状图像的能力，<br/>
so I can compose and decompose music. <br/>
所以我可以组成和分解音乐。<br/>
Hopefully it's a gift! I kind of want to be a pioneer in something with this supposedly natural talent. <br/>
希望这是一种天赋！我还挺想用这个假设是天赋的才能在某个领域当个先驱者。
